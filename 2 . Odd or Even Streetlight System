#2 . Odd or Even Streetlight System 
#A city uses an even-odd rule to manage electricity usage in streetlights. Streetlights with even 
#numbers are turned on at night, while odd-numbered lights remain off. Write a program that 
#takes a streetlight number as input and prints whether it should be ON or OFF.
